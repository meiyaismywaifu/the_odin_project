# Go back to the Caesar Cipher Project and write tests for your code. It shouldnâ€™t take more than a half-dozen tests to cover all the possible cases.

# --- --- ---

# what to test...
# think the given tester loop has to be commented out.
    # forward integer
    # backward integer
    # integer greater than 26
    # fails if shift by non-integer.
        # how would this work? like how would the test be written and what would be the expected outcome in rspec?
    # conserves spaces and non-letters
    # conserves upper/lower casing

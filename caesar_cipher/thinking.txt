- You will need to remember how to convert a string into a number.
- Don’t forget to wrap from z to a.
- Don’t forget to keep the same case."

alphabet reference array

def caesar_cipher(string, integer)
	if integer != integer
		return error message to ask for integer
		
	ciphered_string = ""
	
	loop through string
		if character is an alphabet
			shift, push to ciphered_string
		else
			push character as is to ciphered_string
			
	return ciphered_string	
	
run until exit:
	once: prompt/description
	string: user input string
	shift: user input integer
	call caesar_cipher
	put caesar cipher's result
	end condition: escape key at this time
      actually this appears to be difficult so not gonna bother

   [43] apparently tests for whether something is a number. this is a "regexp", "=~" compares regexp to string. i believe [44] is the proper reduction to whether or not an integer is supplied.
